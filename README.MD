# Pocket wallet

> The crypto wallet for children

This demo project allow a parent (the controller) to manage and provide funds for a child in a smart contract.

![User application](./doc/assets/user_app.png)

## Purpose

A random wallet is generated by the app for the child. 
This wallet will just own some ETH for gas, so if the wallet is lost, it is not a big deal.

The wallet is the key of a contract where the user own money and can send it eo receipients.

## First time initialization

The first time the child accesses the app, a wallet is generated.

The parent will connect to the administration app and enter the child wallet address

![Admin application : First time](./doc/assets/admin_app_firsttime.png)

A pocket wallet contract will be created for the user, and the parent will be able to manage the account
